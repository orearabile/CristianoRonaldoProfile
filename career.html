            <h3>Sporting CP</h3>
            <p>
                After impressing in Sporting CP's youth teams, he was promoted to the main team by first-team manager
                Laszlo Boloni. At age 17, on 14 August 2002, he played his first official match for the team, in a UEFA
                Champions League qualifying round at Jose Alvalade Stadium againts Inter Milan, and his Primeira Liga
                debut, took place a month later against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense
                in their 3-0 win. Over the course of the 2002-03 season, his representatives suggested the player to
                Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Arsene Wenger, who was
                interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible 
                transfer
            </p>
            <p>
                Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently,
                after Sporting defeated United 3-1 at the inauguration of the Estadio Jose Alvalade on 6 August 2003. 
                Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year. Having been 
                impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson said Ronaldo
                was "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.
            </p>
            <h3>Manchester United</h3>
            <section id="cont">
                <section id="sec1">
                    <p>
                        On 12 August 2003, less than a week after the friendly that impressed Ferguson, Manchester United 
                        signed Ronaldo for $12 Million, an England record for a teenager. This also made him the first
                        Portuguese player to sign for the Club. although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting,
                        he received the squad 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such Manchester United players like:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="manuLegends">
                        <li>George Best</li>
                        <li>Eric Cantona</li>
                        <li>David Becham</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his development
                        during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "<span class="txt">He's been my father in Sport,
                        one of the most important and influential factors in my career</span>". Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute 
                        in a 4-0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003. His performace earned
                        praise from Brest, who hailed it as "<span class="txt">undoubtedly the most exciting debut</span>" he had ever seen. Ronaldo scored
                        his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3-0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November. On 15 May
                        2004, in a victory against Aston Villa, Ronaldo scored the opening goal and later received the first red 
                        card of his career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004-05 season, producing a goal and 
                        an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice againtst rivals Arsenal. Ronaldo won his second trophy in 
                        English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4-0 final win over 
                        Wigan Athletic
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. Ronaldo clashed with a 
                        teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.
                        Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney
                        was sent off, Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received
                        from the club over the incident. United denied the possibilty of him leaving the club. Although his world Cup 
                        altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006-07 season.

            <section id="madrid">
                <p id="madrid1">
                    In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then world record $100 million. At least 80,000 fans attended

                    scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so. His first Champions League goals 
                    for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zurich. His strong start to the season 
                    was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined
                    for seven weeks. Despite scoring 33 goals in all competitions and contributing to Real Madrid's 96 points in La Liga

                    in four years with record 100 points and his runner-up finish to Lionel Messi in the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or. He 
                    scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5-1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, breaking the previous club 
                    record held by Ferenc Puskas. In the 2012-13 season, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in 4-1 
                    win over Ajax. Four days later, he became the first player to score in six seccessive Clasico when he hit a brace in 
                    a 2-2 draw at Camp Nou. His performaces again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon D'or

                </p>
                <p id="madrid5">
                    In 2013-14 season, Ronaldo was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale and together with striker Karim Benzema, they
                    formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed "BBC", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the same of
                    British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). He continued prolific scoring, with 69
                    goals in 2013, winning the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, and FIFA World Player of the year award, for the first time in his

                    <p>
                        Ronaldo joined juventus in 2018 for $100 million, the transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old and
                        the highest paid by an italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing
                        Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Perez.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3-2 away win against Chievo Verona. On 19 September, in his first Champions League 
                        appearances. In the reverse (home) leg against Valencia, Cristiano won 100 Champions League matches, becoming the first 
                        ever player to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cristiano won his ever first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the 
                        only goal from a header against AC Milan. On 10 February, Ronaldo scored in 3-0 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away
                        game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Guiseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away 
                        games with at least one goal. On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 home against Athletico in the second leg of the 
                        Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals. On 20 April, Ronaldo 
                        played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2-1 home win, 
                        thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy.
