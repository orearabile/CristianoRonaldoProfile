                        He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Catia "<span class="txt">Katia</span>". He is the fourth and
                        youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry
                        and a cleaning woman, and Jose Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo Antonio
                        and part-time kitman for football club Andorinha His father, Jose, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20. Ronaldo was named after
                        actor and U.S President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of. His mother revealed that she wanted to
                        abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused
                        to perform the precedure. Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.

                        He was drunk nearly every day and when that happens it's not easy to have a conversation, to get to know him a bit 
                        more. I am not ashamed to say it, I did not really get to know my father for real, from the heart, to open up and 
                        tell him things. I never had those kinds of conversations.</span>-Said Cristiano in 2015"

                        Apparently, Ronaldo's brother was also a footballer. Hugo grew up playing for a certain local team in the area. Ronaldo's 
                        brother used to go with him to the training ground, that time Ronaldo was still young. Ronaldo fell in love with the idea
                        of football, and of course inspired by the brother. Ronaldo started his own football club together with his friends. He has 
                        always been fascinated by the idea of football.

            <h3>Childhood</h3>
            <p>
                As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent
                two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for 
                a fee of $1,500. He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system. By age 14, while
                struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area 
                of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor
                at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes, to cease his education to focus entirely on football. With a troubled life as a 
                student, and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 
                6th grade. While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, 
                who he said had "disrespected" him. One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have
                forced him to give up playing football. Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple
                cardiac pathways int one, altering his resting heart rate. He was discharged from the hospital hours after the 
                procedure and resumed training a few days later. In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother stated in an interview for 
                Sporting CP'd official television channel that her son would be a bricklayer if he had not become a professional
                football player
