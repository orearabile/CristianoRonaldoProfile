                In February 2021, Ronaldo became the first person in the world to reach 500 million followers across Facebook,
                Instagram and Twitter. As of May 2025, he had 939 million. In March 2021, he passed Brazilian legend Pele's 
                goal tally, with a hat-trick against Serie A foe Cagliari pushing him up to 770 goals in all competitions. In 
                September 2024, he became the first man ever to reach 900 goals in official matches. He switched teams in 
                August 2021, moving to from Juventus to Manchester United, where he previously played from 2003 to 2009. He 
                then jumped to Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr in December 2022. Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon d'Or winner, in 2020 
                became the first active team-sport athlete to surpass $1 Billion in career earnings. In addition to a lifetime 
                deal with Nike and other endorsements, Ronaldo makes money off the pitch with his CR7-branded clothing, accessories,
                hotels and gyms.

                <p>
                    Cristiano isn't just the most-followed human on Instagram; he's football's first near-billionaire still lacing
                    up his boots. 2025 estimate of Cristiano Ronaldo net worth is roughly US $1.45 Billion, up from about $725 
                    million in 2018. The jump comes from a record-breaking Al-Nassr contract, a lifetime contract with Nike, CR7 hotels 
                    clinic and tech investments, and many luxury assets.

                    One of his most notable business ventures is his partnership with the Pestana Hotel Group. In 2015, Ronaldo teamed
                    up with the luxury Hotel chain to open his first hotel, Pestana CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira. The 
                    hotel features 48 rooms and suites, and a rooftop pool and bar. It has been a popular destination for tourists and 
                    football fans alike. Ronaldo has since opened hotels in Lisbon and Madrid. His real estate portfolio is worth over 
                    $80 million, according to other sources. His most recent addition is $22 million mansion in his home country. His 
                    other properties include a $6 million penthouse apartment in Portugal, a riverside mansion in the Peneda-Geres 
                    National Park, and a warehouse-turned-mansion in Madeira renovated for $7 million, among several others.

                        By managing his earnings, investements and funds; Cristiano Ronaldo decided to offer back to the society by running
                        CR7 foundation. The CR7 foundation is focused on helping children and teenagers from underprivileged backgrounds by 
                        providing them with opportunities to engage in Sports and receive education.

                    <p>
                        Ronaldo emphasizes that his own experience growing up in challenging circumstances inspired him to create 
                        foundation. He believes that every child deserves the chance to pursue their dreams, regardless of their 
                        Background. The foundation will collaborate with local organizations, schools, and sports clubs to create programs
                        aimed at youth development.

                    <p>
                        One of the main initiatives of the foundation is to offer scholarships for gifted students who cannot afford 
                        education at prestigious institutions. Ronaldo hopes that by supporting education, he can help young people break 
                        the cycle of poverty and achieve their goals. If you want to apply for one the bursaries or scholarships offered by
